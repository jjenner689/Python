Please note I made this game originally on Windows and I have not been able to get it to work on ubuntu (which I use now). I have included it all the same.

Just run the vortex.pyx file in the game folder to get it working.

Game Instructions:

Use the arrow keys to move about pacman to collect as many apples/powerups as possible while trying not to get caught by the ghost. Use the vortexs to quickly move across the map, however, watch out for the ghosts who will also use the vortexs to get to you. Hold down space bar to show the destination of the vortex which is closest to you.

As the levels increase, the speed of pacman and the ghosts will increase, the ghosts will get faster reactions and more vortexs will appear.
